                <h3>Kouo Ltd</h3>
                <h4>Hardware Engineer</h4>
		<h4>Heart sensor project<h4>    
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Researched and purchased a number of ECG and PPG sensors for testing. Decided on the best over a range of metrics.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Once the sensor was selected I worked in C++ to get the heartrate, then I worked in Python on Pycharm to develop a breathing rate algorithm.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        By the end of the summer I had integrated the sensor into Kouo's existing hardware.
                    </li>
                </ul>
		<h4>Sweat sensor project<h4>    
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Similarly to the previous project I researched and purchased a number of sweat detecting sensors.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        All the sensors were tested on a number of metrics such as sensitivity, to test them I recorded their response whilst relaxing and also whilst sweating.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I collated the results of the project into a report.

                    </li>
                </ul>
		<h4>Material testing<h4>    
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        I tested a number of materials to observe their efficacy as EEG electrodes. To carry out this testing I used a wavegenerator to simulate the EEG signal the brain would emit and amplified the signal after it had passed through the material undertest so it could be observed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        All the materials were tested on a number of metrics such as frequency response and amplitude.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I collated the results of the project into a report.

				helped me to develope project management skills. I also improved my technical skills.

				We built a device alongside an app that would help people to follow their prescriptions with features such as highlighting medications that shouldn't be taken together.
				I designed and tested the ultrasound sensor system through which developing debugging skills.
			    I also worked on code for the motors used for dispensing this improved my C++ coding skills.

                              electronics. I coded the symbols and the positioning of their ports, I developed integration skills through working in a team. I developed FSharp coding skills writing code throughout the project.

                           I worked on our leaflet and presentation outlining Minexx’s work and our part within it. This helped me to develope marketing and pitching skills.
                           I also worked on the code of the website, in turn improving my HTML and CSS coding skills.
