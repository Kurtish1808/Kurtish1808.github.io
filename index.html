                <h3>Kouo Ltd</h3>
                <h4>Hardware Engineer</h4>
		<h4>Heart sensor project<h4>    
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Researched and purchased a number of ECG and PPG sensors for testing. Decided on the best over a range of metrics.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Once the sensor was selected I worked in C++ to get the heartrate, then I worked in Python on Pycharm to develop a breathing rate algorithm.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        By the end of the summer I had integrated the sensor into Kouo's existing hardware.
                    </li>
                </ul>
		<h4>Sweat sensor project<h4>    
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Similarly to the previous project I researched and purchased a number of sweat detecting sensors.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        All the sensors were tested on a number of metrics such as sensitivity, to test them I recorded their response whilst relaxing and also whilst sweating.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I collated the results of the project into a report.

                    </li>
                </ul>
		<h4>Material testing<h4>    
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        I tested a number of materials to observe their efficacy as EEG electrodes. To carry out this testing I used a wavegenerator to simulate the EEG signal the brain would emit and amplified the signal after it had passed through the material undertest so it could be observed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        All the materials were tested on a number of metrics such as frequency response and amplitude.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I collated the results of the project into a report.

                            A project for EE3-23 Introduction To Machine Learning
                            where I worked on a machine learning model to train models using datasets of red and white
                            variants of the Portuguese ”Vinho Verde” wine in order to
                            predict the wine rating as accurately as possible. The dataset
                            contains 11 inputs of objective tests (e.g.
                            PH values) and one target rating, which is based on
                            sensory data(median of at least 3 evaluations made by wine
                            experts). The project explored different approaches to classification algorithms and their advantages/disadvantages in the context of this dataset.

                        <p>
                            As part of the Third-Year Embedded Systems course we were required to design, using a list of available sensor, an IoT device
                            which is connected to a online platform using the MQTT protocol for lightweight data transfer. We came up with SwimTime, an device which
                            using an ultra-sonic distance sensor would act as a swimming companion by measuring lap times and speed. This device would then transfer the 
                            data to a online Dashboard where the user would be able to monitor his/her progress in the swimming pool. The device was designed as a proof-of-concept 
                            and implemented on a breadboard.
